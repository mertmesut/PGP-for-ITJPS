  However, if matlab is not installed, you can install the necessary tools and application by running    
  \PGPforIJPS\for_redistribution/MyAppInstaller_web.exe. 
SUMMARY
  The formulas used to obtain the ideal Turbojet Performance Graphs were converted to 
  Graphs using matlab. User Interface is defined to allow the user to easily modify the resulting 
  graph and provide a simpler image rather than complex results
DESIGN
  A simple design has been developed so that the user can easily obtain the desired
